# RP2040 Flash Bootloader in Rust

The RP2040 uses a two-stage bootloader scheme, where ROM loads the first 256
bytes from an attached Flash chip into RAM and executes it. That 256 byte
program is responsible for setting up Flash to run the _rest_ of the code.

Normally this program is written in assembly language. I was curious to see if
it could be done in Rust.

Spoiler: at least for the W25Q080 bootloader, the answer is yes.
